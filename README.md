# Files and Directory Entries API

## What is this?

This specification attempts to document the `Entry`, `FileEntry` and
`DirectoryEntry` types and related entry points that allow scripts
access to the contents of directories made available to web pages by
drag-and-drop operations in Google Chrome and other web browsers that
have implemented the API for compatibility.
