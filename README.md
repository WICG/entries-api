[![CI](https://github.com/WICG/entries-api/actions/workflows/auto-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WICG/entries-api/actions/workflows/auto-publish.yml)

## What is this?

This specification attempts to document the `FileEntry` and
`DirectoryEntry` types and related entry points that allow scripts
access to the contents of directories made available to web pages by
drag-and-drop operations in Google Chrome and other web browsers that
have implemented the API for compatibility.

For more context, please read the [Explainer](EXPLAINER.md).
